  <h2 id="eligibility">1) Eligibility & accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least <strong>13</strong> years old (or the age of digital consent in your country; 16 in parts of the EEA/UK). If under 18, you represent you have parental permission.</li>
    <li>Provide accurate information and keep it updated. You’re responsible for safeguarding your credentials and all activity under your account.</li>
    <li>We may offer third-party sign-in (e.g., Google); your use of those services is governed by their terms and privacy policies.</li>
    <li>We may refuse, reclaim, or remove usernames at our discretion (e.g., impersonation, trademark complaints, inactivity).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="changes">2) Changes to Terms & Service</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms and modify or discontinue parts of the Service. When required, we will provide notice (e.g., in-app). Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2 id="service">3) About the Service; features & metrics</h2>
  <p>The Service is a social video platform where users create profiles, upload videos, follow others, and view feeds such as “For You” (personalized) and “Following”. We use automated systems to rank and recommend content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Counts & metrics:</strong> follower counts, likes, and views may be delayed, estimated, or filtered (e.g., spam detection). They are for general information only.</li>
    <li><strong>Verified badge:</strong> At <em>35,000 followers</em> or at our discretion, accounts may receive a blue verification badge indicating authenticity. We may grant, withhold, or revoke verification at any time (e.g., for impersonation, policy violations, name changes, or loss of eligibility).</li>
    <li><strong>Private accounts:</strong> Private mode limits who can view your content; however, certain metadata (e.g., username, avatar) may remain visible to others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="user-content">4) User Content; licenses</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of videos, images, text, audio, and other materials you submit (“<strong>User Content</strong>”).</p>
  <h3>License to ScriptNova</h3>
  <p>By submitting User Content, you grant ScriptNova a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to host, store, cache, reproduce, adapt (e.g., transcode, reformat, generate thumbnails/captions), create derivative works (e.g., previews and compilations), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute your User Content in connection with operating, improving, and promoting the Service. This license lasts for the period your content is available on the Service and for a reasonable period afterward for backups, logs, dispute resolution, and legal compliance.</p>
  <h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You have all necessary rights to your content and the authority to grant the license above.</li>
    <li>Your content must comply with law and these Terms (including copyright, trademark, privacy, and publicity rights).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for the content you post and for any consequences of sharing it.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Removal & backups</h3>
  <p>Deleting content removes it from public view. Copies may persist for a limited time in backups, caches, or where others have already downloaded/shared it.</p>

  <h2 id="music">5) Music & third-party rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not upload music, sound recordings, or other materials unless you have all required rights (including performance, mechanical, sync, and master rights). You are solely responsible for obtaining clearances and paying royalties if applicable.</li>
    <li>If we offer a licensed music library, you may use tracks as permitted by that library’s terms within Allstars.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="guidelines">6) Community guidelines & prohibited conduct</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Post content that is illegal; exploits or endangers children; incites violence; contains hate or harassment; is sexually explicit; promotes self-harm or dangerous activities; or includes others’ personal data without consent.</li>
    <li>Upload or share content you don’t have rights to (e.g., third-party TV, films, sports, music, or other copyrighted material).</li>
    <li>Spam, manipulate metrics (likes, views, follows), run scams or deceptive promotions, sell or barter accounts, or operate undisclosed bots.</li>
    <li>Impersonate individuals or organizations; misrepresent your affiliation or identity.</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer, probe, or disrupt the Service; introduce malware; scrape or harvest data except as permitted by a documented API and our express permission.</li>
    <li>Attempt to access accounts without authorization or circumvent security controls.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="moderation">7) Moderation & enforcement</h2>
  <p>We may remove or restrict User Content; limit visibility; disable features; suspend or terminate accounts; or take other action at our discretion to protect users, comply with law, and enforce these Terms and our policies. We may notify you of enforcement actions, but are not obligated to disclose details of internal processes. You may appeal certain actions by contacting <a href="mailto:gomegaassist@gmail.com">gomegaassist@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="feedback">8) Feedback</h2>
  <p>If you provide suggestions or ideas, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use them without restriction or attribution.</p>

  <h2 id="third">9) Third-party services & links</h2>
  <p>The Service may include links to or integrations with third-party services (e.g., Google sign-in, hosting, analytics). We do not control those services and are not responsible for their content or practices. Your use of them is at your own risk and subject to their terms.</p>

  <h2 id="purchases">10) Purchases, subscriptions & virtual items</h2>
  <p>Allstars currently does not offer paid subscriptions or virtual items. If introduced later, purchases made through app stores are subject to the applicable store’s terms and refund policies; some purchases may be non-refundable except as required by law. We may change prices and features with appropriate notice where required.</p>

  <h2 id="beta">11) Beta/experimental features</h2>
  <p>We may release features labeled “beta,” “preview,” or similar. These may be incomplete, change at any time, or be discontinued. They are provided “as is.” Usage may be subject to additional terms.</p>

  <h2 id="privacy">12) Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we handle personal information and cookies/SDKs.</p>

  <h2 id="ip">13) Intellectual property & trademarks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Allstars, the Allstars logo, ScriptNova, and associated marks are trademarks or trade dress of ScriptNova. You may not use them without our written permission.</li>
    <li>The Service, including software, UI, and design, is protected by intellectual property laws. Except as permitted here, you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="dmca">14) Copyright/DMCA</h2>
  <p>We respect copyright. If you believe content infringes your rights, send a notice containing the information required by 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3) to: <a href="mailto:gomegaassist@gmail.com">gomegaassist@gmail.com</a>. We may remove content and terminate repeat infringers. Counter-notices may be submitted as permitted by law.</p>

  <h2 id="disclaimers">15) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE, OR THAT CONTENT WILL BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE.</p>

  <h2 id="liability">16) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SCRIPTNOVA AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF <strong>$100</strong> OR THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US (IF ANY) DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion/limitation of certain damages; to that extent, some of the above may not apply to you.</p>

  <h2 id="indemnity">17) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ScriptNova, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your User Content; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of any rights of another.</p>

  <h2 id="governing">18) Governing law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where ScriptNova is organized and operates, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, except where otherwise required by mandatory local law.</p>

  <h2 id="arbitration">19) Arbitration & class-action waiver (U.S.)</h2>
  <p><strong>Please read carefully.</strong> Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. Arbitration will be held in a location reasonably convenient or by telephone/video as appropriate. You and ScriptNova agree that each may bring claims only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If the class-action waiver is found unenforceable, this Section is severed and disputes will be resolved in court with jurisdiction and venue as permitted by Section 18.</p>
  <p><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You may opt out of arbitration by emailing <a href="mailto:gomegaassist@gmail.com">gomegaassist@gmail.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms (subject line: “Arbitration Opt-Out”).</p>

  <h2 id="export">20) Export control & sanctions</h2>
  <p>You may not use or access the Service in, or export it to, countries or persons embargoed or sanctioned under applicable law. You represent that you are not on any government sanctions list.</p>

  <h2 id="misc">21) Miscellaneous</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ScriptNova regarding the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force.</li>
    <li><strong>No waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</li>
    <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign them without restriction.</li>
    <li><strong>Force majeure:</strong> We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic communications:</strong> You consent to receive communications electronically (e.g., in-app, email).</li>
    <li><strong>Survival:</strong> Sections that by their nature should survive (licenses, payments, disclaimers, limitations, arbitration, indemnity) will survive termination.</li>
