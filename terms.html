  <ul>
    <li><strong>Arbitration</strong>: Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. Arbitration will be held in <em>[CITY, STATE]</em>, or by telephone/video where appropriate.</li>
    <li><strong>Class‑action waiver</strong>: You and we agree that each may bring claims only in our individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
    <li><strong>Small claims</strong>: Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt‑out</strong>: You may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:[CONTACT EMAIL]">[CONTACT EMAIL]</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the class‑action waiver is found unenforceable, this Section 14 is severed and disputes will be resolved in court (Section 13).</p>

  <h2 id="misc">15) Miscellaneous</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Entire agreement</strong>: These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Severability</strong>: If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force.</li>
    <li><strong>No waiver</strong>: Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</li>
    <li><strong>Assignment</strong>: You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign them without restriction.</li>
    <li><strong>Force majeure</strong>: We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control.</li>
