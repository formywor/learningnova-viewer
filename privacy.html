  <h2 id="collect">2) Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the categories below. Some information is <em>required</em> to create an account or use core features (e.g., uploads), while other information is optional.</p>
  <h3>2.1 Account & profile</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifiers: name/display name, username/handle, email, password (stored as hash), user ID, verification status.</li>
    <li>Profile details: bio, avatar/photo, links, account type (public/private), counts (followers, following).</li>
    <li>Third‑party sign‑in: if you choose to sign in with Google or other SSO, we receive identifiers and tokens needed to authenticate you (e.g., your Google account ID, email, display name). We do not receive your password for the third‑party service.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.2 Content & social graph</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Videos, images, captions, hashtags, comments, likes, views, timestamps, and related metadata (e.g., video file type, length, upload date).</li>
    <li>Follows/followers relationships; blocks, reports, and enforcement records.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.3 Device & usage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device data: OS, app version, language, device model, mobile carrier, crash logs.</li>
    <li>Network data: IP address, approximate location inferred from IP, timestamp, user‑agent, referrer.</li>
    <li>Usage data: pages/screens viewed, taps/clicks, video watch time, features used, in‑app navigation, performance metrics.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.4 Cookies & local storage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Session and authentication cookies; preferences (e.g., muted/autoplay); analytics cookies; and, if implemented, advertising cookies or identifiers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.5 Communications</h3>

    <li>Messages you send to us (support, feedback), email open rates, and notification preferences.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.6 Sensitive data</h3>
  <p>We do not seek to collect sensitive personal data unless you provide it to us voluntarily (e.g., in a bio) or it is strictly necessary for legal reasons. Please avoid sharing sensitive data in public content.</p>

  <h2 id="sources">3) Sources of information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You</strong>: when you register, upload, follow/like/comment, or contact us.</li>
    <li><strong>Automated collection</strong>: via the app/website, SDKs, cookies, and similar technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Third parties</strong>: sign‑in providers (e.g., Google), analytics, anti‑abuse services, and other users (e.g., reports).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="use">4) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide and maintain</strong> the Service (create accounts, enable uploads/hosting/streaming via providers such as Firebase, display feeds and recommendations, store preferences, remember you across sessions).</li>
    <li><strong>Safety, integrity & moderation</strong> (detect spam/abuse/violations, enforce policies, debug issues, prevent fraud and security incidents).</li>
    <li><strong>Personalization</strong> ("For You" vs "Following" feeds, creator suggestions, ranking and recommendations).</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong> (measure usage, performance, and improve features).</li>
    <li><strong>Communications</strong> (service messages, changes to terms, support replies; optional marketing with your consent where required).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal & compliance</strong> (regulatory obligations, DPA requests, enforcing our Terms, or protecting rights and safety).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="share">5) How we share information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers / processors</strong>: cloud hosting, storage, databases, content delivery, analytics, customer support, and security vendors (e.g., services like Firebase Auth/Firestore/Storage, crash reporting, and email providers). They act under contract and may only process data as instructed.</li>
    <li><strong>Public & other users</strong>: your profile, display name, avatar, bio, counts, and content you post are visible to others based on your settings (e.g., public vs private account). Likes and follows may be visible.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers</strong>: as part of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal</strong>: to comply with law, enforce our agreements, or respond to lawful requests.</li>
    <li><strong>With consent</strong>: we may share in other ways with your explicit consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="small"><em>We do not knowingly sell personal information for money. If we engage in "sharing" for cross‑context behavioral advertising under the CPRA, you will have a right to opt out—see the U.S. addendum.</em></p>

  <h2 id="cookies">6) Cookies & similar technologies</h2>
  <p>We use the following categories of cookies/identifiers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strictly necessary</strong> (authentication, security, load balancing).</li>
    <li><strong>Functional</strong> (preferences like autoplay, volume).</li>
    <li><strong>Performance/analytics</strong> (aggregate usage and diagnostics).</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising</strong> (only if implemented; used to deliver/measure ads and limit frequency).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can manage cookies via your browser settings and (where provided) our in‑product controls. Blocking some cookies may impact functionality.</p>

  <h2 id="ads">7) Personalization & advertising</h2>
  <p>We personalize content (e.g., recommended videos, accounts to follow) based on your activity. If we show ads or use third‑party ad partners in the future, we will update this Policy and provide controls, including opt‑out where required by law.</p>

  <h2 id="retention">8) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account/profile data: retained while your account is active. If you delete your account, we delete or de‑identify your personal data within a reasonable period, except where we must retain it for legal, security, or fraud‑prevention reasons.</li>
    <li>Content (videos, comments): retained while posted; removed upon deletion or account closure, subject to caching and backup cycles.</li>
    <li>Logs/analytics: retained for up to <em>[X months]</em> unless longer is needed for security, legal obligations, or product improvement in aggregate form.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="security">9) Security</h2>
  <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the information (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). No system is 100% secure; you are responsible for maintaining the security of your login credentials.</p>

  <h2 id="transfers">10) International data transfers</h2>
  <p>We may transfer, store, and process information outside your country (for example, in the United States). Where required, we use appropriate safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and risk assessments for cross‑border transfers.</p>

  <h2 id="your-rights">11) Your privacy rights</h2>
  <p>Your rights depend on your location. They may include the right to request access, correction, deletion, portability, restriction, and to object to certain processing (including profiling). You also have the right to withdraw consent and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
  <p><strong>Exercising rights:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:[CONTACT EMAIL]">[CONTACT EMAIL]</a> or use in‑app settings (where available). We will verify your identity, respond within the applicable timeframe, and explain if any exceptions apply.</p>

  <h2 id="children">12) Children</h2>
  <p>The Service is not directed to children and you may not use it if you are under <strong>13</strong> (or the age of digital consent in your country—<strong>16</strong> in parts of the EEA/UK). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

  <h2 id="dnt">13) Do Not Track</h2>
  <p>Your browser may send a “Do Not Track” signal; because there is no common standard, we do not respond to DNT signals. We honor legally required browser‑based opt‑out signals where applicable (e.g., Global Privacy Control for certain U.S. states).</p>

  <h2 id="changes">14) Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date shows when changes were made. If changes are material, we will provide additional notice (e.g., in‑app or by email). Your continued use means you accept the updated Policy.</p>
